# NEU-Projects
ALY_6040_PythonProject
This is the final project from Northeastern ALY 6040 Data Mining Class Spring 2018
We are looking at blood samples that have been sent through a mass spec 
Once we create a single data base (first version) we will look at using ETL and EDA to find insights in the data. 
This is practice for learning python and a learning process. 

I will look at applying the same code to individual data sheets depending on sample. 
This will wait until after I had a chance to talk with DR.M. VISSER who will be the subject matter expert guide.
